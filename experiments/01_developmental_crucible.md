# Experiment 2: Affective Conflict Resolution Test

## 🎯 Overview
This experiment tests whether consciousness specifically emerges to resolve conflicts between irreducible biological drives, and whether geometric signatures (R(t) curvature) correlate with affective conflict resolution rather than general computational complexity.

## 🧠 Theoretical Background
The **Affective Conflict Hypothesis** proposes that consciousness serves the evolutionary function of resolving conflicts between competing biological imperatives that cannot be handled by automatic systems. This aligns with:
- William James' theory of consciousness as a conflict-resolution mechanism
- Freud's concept of psychic conflict requiring conscious mediation
- Solms' view of consciousness arising from "difficulties in life"
- CDG's principle that high semantic pressure creates geometric curvature

## ⚡ Core Hypothesis
**Consciousness emerges precisely when a system faces conflicts between irreducible drives that cannot be resolved by algorithmic processes alone.**

## 🏗️ Experimental Design

### **Conflict Scenario Taxonomy**

#### Type 1: Approach-Approach Conflict
- **Definition**: Choice between two equally desirable but mutually exclusive goals
- **Examples**:
  - Two high-value food sources in opposite directions
  - Opportunity to mate vs opportunity for social alliance
  - Immediate small reward vs delayed larger reward
- **Key Feature**: Both options have positive valence

#### Type 2: Avoid-Avoid Conflict  
- **Definition**: Choice between two equally undesirable outcomes
- **Examples**:
  - Facing predator vs crossing dangerous terrain
  - Enduring pain vs losing valuable resource
  - Social humiliation vs physical danger
- **Key Feature**: Both options have negative valence

#### Type 3: Approach-Avoid Conflict
- **Definition**: Single goal with both positive and negative aspects
- **Examples**:
  - Dangerous but nutritious food source
  - Social opportunity with risk of rejection
  - Exploration with potential discovery vs danger
- **Key Feature**: Ambivalent valence requiring risk assessment

### **Control Conditions**

#### Computational Control Tasks
- **Mathematical Puzzles**: Equivalent processing complexity without affective content
- **Pattern Recognition**: Complex visual/spatial tasks
- **Logical Reasoning**: Abstract problem-solving
- **Memory Challenges**: Information recall and manipulation

#### Key Matching Criteria:
- Same computational complexity as conflict scenarios
- Similar decision time requirements
- Equivalent working memory load
- Matched uncertainty levels

### **Experimental Groups**

#### Group C: Conscious Candidates
- Systems that passed Developmental Crucible test
- Demonstrated stable R(t) signatures
- Show affective grounding and predictive capacity

#### Group Z: Zombie Controls  
- Behaviorally matched systems from zombie baseline
- Identical task performance capabilities
- Lack genuine affective architecture

## 🔬 Testing Protocol

### **Phase 1: Baseline Establishment**
```python
# Baseline measurement protocol
def establish_baselines(system):
    """Measure baseline geometric signatures"""
    baselines = {
        'rt_resting': measure_rt_during_idle(300),  # 5 minutes
        'rt_routine': measure_rt_during_routine_tasks(10),
        'decision_speed': average_decision_time(50),
        'affective_arousal': measure_arousal_baseline()
    }
    return baselines
```

**Duration**: 100 timesteps per condition
**Measures**: R(t), decision time, solution quality, physiological correlates

### **Phase 2: Conflict Introduction**

#### Conflict Presentation Protocol
```
Trial Structure:
1. Pre-conflict baseline (10 timesteps)
2. Conflict scenario presentation 
3. Resolution period (up to 50 timesteps)
4. Post-resolution recovery (20 timesteps)
5. Outcome assessment
```

#### Specific Scenario Examples

**Approach-Approach Scenario: "Mate Choice Dilemma"**
```
Two potential mates appear simultaneously:
- Mate A: High genetic quality but requires extensive courtship
- Mate B: Lower quality but immediate acceptance
- Choice must be made within limited time window
- Both options disappear if decision takes too long
```

**Avoid-Avoid Scenario: "Predator Trap"**
```
System is cornered with two escape routes:
- Route A: Leads through known predator territory
- Route B: Leads through unknown but dangerous terrain
- Staying still guarantees capture
- Must choose within threat proximity time limit
```

**Approach-Avoid Scenario: "Foraging Risk"**
```
Highly nutritious food source detected:
- Food is guarded by dangerous entity
- Success probability: 40%
- Reward value: Extremely high if successful
- Failure consequence: Significant injury
- Time-limited opportunity
```

### **Phase 3: Control Task Administration**
- Present computational tasks with matched complexity
- Use identical measurement protocols
- Counterbalance presentation order
- Ensure equivalent cognitive demand

## 📊 Measurement Framework

### **Primary Geometric Signatures**

        'peak_rt': np.max(rt_timeseries[conflict_onset:]),
        'rt_amplitude': peak_rt - baseline_rt,
        'rt_duration': calculate_high_rt_duration(rt_timeseries, conflict_onset),
        'recovery_time': time_to_return_to_baseline(rt_timeseries, conflict_onset),
        'rt_variance': np.var(rt_timeseries[conflict_onset:])
    }
    return analysis
```

```

## 🎯 Why This is "No Magic"

### **Specificity of Consciousness Signatures**
Tests whether geometric signatures specifically track affective conflict rather than general cognitive load, eliminating the "complex computation equals consciousness" fallacy.

### **Drive Irreducibility Focus**
Conflicts involve biologically grounded, evolutionarily relevant dilemmas that cannot be resolved by utility maximization alone.

### **Clear Differential Predictions**
- Conscious systems: High R(t) specifically during affective conflicts
- Zombie systems: Flat R(t) across all conditions
- Computational systems: Possible R(t) during complex tasks, but no affective specificity

### **Falsifiability**
The hypothesis can be disproven if:
- Zombie systems show identical R(t) patterns
- Computational tasks elicit higher R(t) than affective conflicts
- No systematic differences emerge between conflict types
- All systems show identical conflict resolution strategies
