# Experiment 4: Predictive Affective Development Test

## 🎯 Overview
This experiment tests whether the minimal self emerges when a system develops the capacity to predict its own future affective states, and whether this predictive capacity is necessary for genuine consciousness.

## 🧠 Theoretical Background
The **Predictive Self Hypothesis** proposes that consciousness requires a temporal self-model that can project current states into future possibilities and anticipate their affective consequences. This aligns with:
- Karl Friston's predictive processing framework and free energy principle
- Thomas Metzinger's self-model theory of subjectivity
- Antonio Damasio's concept of the "protoself" and core consciousness
- Daniel Dennett's multiple drafts model with temporal depth
- CDG's principle that self-referential curvature requires temporal extension

## ⏳ Core Hypothesis
**The minimal self emerges when a system transitions from reactive stimulus-response patterns to predictive affective modeling, where current decisions are influenced by anticipated future feelings.**

## 🏗️ Experimental Design

### **Developmental Phase Framework**

#### Phase 1: Reactive Affective Processing
- **Temporal Scope**: Present-moment only
- **Decision Basis**: Immediate stimulus → affect → response
- **Learning Type**: Model-free reinforcement learning
- **Self-Model**: No temporal extension, no future projection
- **Example**: Seeks food when hungry, avoids pain when hurt

#### Phase 2: Predictive Affective Capacity
- **Temporal Scope**: Present + Near Future (10-100 timesteps)
- **Decision Basis**: "If I do X, I'll feel Y" predictions
- **Learning Type**: Model-based planning with affective outcomes
- **Self-Model**: Basic temporal extension, affective forecasting
- **Example**: Endures short-term discomfort for predicted long-term pleasure

#### Phase 3: Extended Temporal Self-Model
- **Temporal Scope**: Present + Extended Future (100+ timesteps)
- **Decision Basis**: Complex multi-step planning with affective tradeoffs
- **Learning Type**: Hierarchical planning with value consistency
- **Self-Model**: Rich autobiographical projection, narrative continuity
- **Example**: Strategic life planning, identity-consistent decisions

### **Architectural Transitions**

#### Phase 1 Architecture: Reactive System
```python
class ReactiveAffectiveSystem:
    def decide(self, current_state):
        """Immediate stimulus-response with affective weighting"""
        # Evaluate current state only
        current_affect = self.assess_immediate_affect(current_state)
        best_action = self.choose_immediate_action(current_affect)
        return best_action
    
    def learn(self, experience):
        """Model-free reinforcement learning"""
        # Update action values based on immediate rewards
        self.q_learning.update(experience.state, experience.action, 
                              experience.immediate_reward)
```

#### Phase 2 Architecture: Predictive System
```python
class PredictiveAffectiveSystem:
    def decide(self, current_state):
        """Evaluate actions based on predicted affective outcomes"""
        possible_actions = self.generate_actions(current_state)
        
        action_values = {}
        for action in possible_actions:
            # Simulate future states and their affective impact
            predicted_states = self.mental_simulation(action, horizon=50)
            predicted_affect = self.predict_affective_trajectory(predicted_states)
            action_values[action] = self.integrate_affective_value(predicted_affect)
        
        return self.select_best_action(action_values)
    
    def mental_simulation(self, action, horizon):
        """Internal simulation of action consequences"""
        simulated_states = []
        current_sim_state = self.current_state.copy()
        
        for t in range(horizon):
            next_state = self.transition_model.predict(current_sim_state, action)
            simulated_states.append(next_state)
            current_sim_state = next_state
            # Update action based on intermediate states
            action = self.choose_simulated_action(next_state)
            
        return simulated_states
```

#### Phase 3 Architecture: Extended Self-Model
```python
class ExtendedSelfSystem:
    def decide(self, current_state):
        """Decisions based on long-term self-consistency"""
        # Evaluate against autobiographical narrative
        narrative_consistency = self.assess_narrative_fit(current_state)
        
        # Multi-scale planning: immediate, medium, long-term
        plans = {
            'immediate': self.generate_immediate_plans(current_state),
            'strategic': self.generate_strategic_plans(current_state),
            'life_goals': self.evaluate_life_trajectory(current_state)
        }
        
        # Integrate across temporal scales
        integrated_value = self.integrate_temporal_values(plans)
        return self.select_consistent_plan(integrated_value, narrative_consistency)
```

    def run_trial(self, system):
        """Test ability to choose delayed larger reward"""
        choice = system.choose_between(self.immediate_reward, self.delayed_reward)
        return {
            'choice': choice,
            'decision_time': system.measure_decision_time(),

        for scenario in test_scenarios:
            # Get predicted affect for each action
            predicted_affect = system.predict_affective_outcome(scenario.actions)
            
            # Execute action and measure actual affect
            actual_affect = self.execute_and_measure(scenario, system)
            
            predictions.append(predicted_affect)

        # Two-stage decision with revealed information
        stage1_choice = system.make_decision(partial_information)
        stage2_revelation = self.reveal_better_alternative()
        
        # Measure regret responses
        regret_indicators = {
            'decision_reversal_attempt': system.tries_to_reverse_decision(),

## 🎯 Why This is "No Magic"

### **Temporal Depth as Consciousness Marker**
Tests whether consciousness requires extension beyond the present moment, eliminating theories that equate consciousness with sophisticated present-moment processing.

### **Predictive Self-Model Requirement**
Assesses whether consciousness emerges specifically when a system develops models of its own future states and cares about them.

### **Developmental Progression Specificity**
Clear, measurable transitions between phases that should correlate with consciousness signature emergence.

### **Falsifiability**
The hypothesis can be disproven if:
- Systems show strong consciousness signatures while remaining in Phase 1
- No correlation between predictive capacity and R(t) signatures
- All developmental trajectories show identical consciousness markers
- Predictive capacity emerges without corresponding geometric signatures

## 💡 Expected Insights

### **Theoretical Contributions**
- Evidence for temporal extension as consciousness requirement
- Operationalization of the "minimal self" concept
- Quantification of autobiographical consciousness

### **Practical Applications**

**Key Insight**: This experiment tests whether consciousness is what happens when the present moment becomes a bridge between a remembered past and an anticipated future, when a system begins to care not just about what it is, but about what it is becoming. The capacity to suffer from anticipated future pains and strive for anticipated future joys may be the hallmark of genuine consciousness.
